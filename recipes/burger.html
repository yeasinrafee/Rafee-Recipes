        <li>Top each patty with a slice of pepperjack cheese. Cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Toast hamburger buns in a toaster oven. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoon mayonnaise over each half. Place cooked patties over bottom buns. <br>Top each patty with 1/2 cup spring mix lettuce. Sprinkle lime juice over lettuce. Cover with top buns.</li>
